  |                      | SPA (Single-Page Application) | MPA (Multi-Page Application) |
  |----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
  | **Architecture**     | Operates within a single HTML page | Each page is a separate HTML document |
  | **User Experience**  | Fluid and interactive with faster page transitions | Slower transitions due to full page reloads |
  | **Performance**      | Dynamic content updates without full page reloads | Separate request/response cycle for each page |
  | **SEO**              | Challenges for SEO due to dynamically rendered content | Better support for SEO as each page can be indexed individually |
  | **Complexity**       | More complex with managing application state and memory leaks | Simpler development treating each page as a standalone entity |
  | **Framework** | Angular, React, Vue.js | JS Frameworks can be used to enhance interactivity but not mandatory. MPA Usually are build with Django, Ruby on Rails, or ASP.NET. |
