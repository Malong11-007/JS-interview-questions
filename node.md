**1. Is JavaScript single threaded or multi threaded?**
  - JavaScript is primarily single-threaded, executing one task at a time.
  - Asynchronous behavior is possible in JavaScript through concepts like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
  - The Event Loop manages the execution of asynchronous operations in an event-driven manner.
  - JavaScript can interact with multi-threaded environments like web browsers through Web APIs such as Web Workers.
  - Understanding JavaScript's single-threaded nature is essential for writing efficient and responsive code.
    
**2. Explain how nodejs handles async operations?**

**3. What are generators?**

  - ðŸ’¡ Generators are often misunderstood but can be incredibly useful in JavaScript.
  - ðŸ’¡ The `function*` syntax denotes a generator function.
  - ðŸ’¡ The `yield` keyword is used to return values sequentially from a generator.
  - ðŸ’¡ The `next` function executes the code inside the generator and returns the yielded values.
  - ðŸ’¡ Multiple generator instances can run concurrently.
  - ðŸ’¡ Generators are useful for creating infinite loops and generating unique identifiers.
  - ðŸ’¡ Generators can be used as iterators with the `next` function.
  - ðŸ’¡ Values can be passed to `next` to affect the iteration.
  - ðŸ’¡ The `return` function allows for premature exit from a generator.
  - ðŸ’¡ The `throw` function can be used to throw errors within a generator.
  - ðŸ’¡ Under the hood async/await uses generators.
  - Use cases: These are some of the main use cases for generators in JavaScript. Generators provide a powerful way to control the flow of execution and create iterable sequences of values or actions.
      1. Infinite Loops: Generators can be used to create infinite loops that don't freeze the program. Unlike regular loops, generators execute one step at a time, allowing you to generate values or perform actions repeatedly without blocking the program.
      2. Unique Identifiers: Generators are useful for generating unique IDs. By using a generator function, you can continuously yield new ID values without the need for manual tracking or potential clashes.
      3. Iterators: Generators can be used as iterators, which are objects or functions that provide a sequence of values. You can iterate over these values using the `next()` method to access each value and determine if the iteration is complete.
      4. Converting Arrays to Iterators: Generators simplify the process of converting arrays into iterators. By defining a generator function that yields each element of an array, you can easily iterate over the array's values one at a time.
