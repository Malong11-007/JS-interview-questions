**1. Is JavaScript single threaded or multi threaded?**
  - JavaScript is primarily single-threaded, executing one task at a time.
  - Asynchronous behavior is possible in JavaScript through concepts like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
  - The Event Loop manages the execution of asynchronous operations in an event-driven manner.
  - JavaScript can interact with multi-threaded environments like web browsers through Web APIs such as Web Workers.
  - Understanding JavaScript's single-threaded nature is essential for writing efficient and responsive code.
    
**2. Explain how nodejs handles async operations?**
