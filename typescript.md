**1. What is Typescript?**

  - 🏷️ TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft.
  - 🏷️ It introduces static typing for catching errors at compile-time.
  - 🏷️ TypeScript enhances code maintainability with features like enums, interfaces, types etc.
  - 🏷️ It provides a better development experience with powerful tools and IDE support.
  - 🏷️ It allows for gradual adoption and seamless integration with existing JavaScript codebases.
  - 🏷️ The TypeScript compiler is responsible for converting TypeScript code (.ts or .tsx files) into JavaScript code (.js files) that can be executed by a JavaScript runtime environment.
  - 🏷️ The TypeScript compiler provides various options and configurations that can be specified through command-line arguments or by using a tsconfig.json file. These options allow you to customize the compilation process, enable strict type checking, target specific JavaScript versions, and more.

**2. What are access modifiers?**
  - 🏷️ Access modifiers in TypeScript allow you to control the visibility and accessibility of class members, enforcing encapsulation and providing more robust and maintainable code.
  - 🏷️ Following are the types:
    - **Public** (default): Public members are accessible from anywhere, both within the class and from external code. This is the default access modifier if none is explicitly specified.
    - **Private**: Private members are only accessible within the class in which they are defined. They cannot be accessed or modified from outside the class.
    - **Protected**: Protected members are accessible within the class that defines them and in derived classes (subclasses). They are not accessible from external code.
